# Jekyll HTML5 Boilerplate
This is a HTML5 boilerplate for the Jekyll blogging framework. It's built to be a bare-bones starter pack for developing a website using Jekyll. When I originally started using Jekyll, there was nothing to get me started, so I built it.

## Features
The features it has are what I think are the essentials:
* HTML5 structure using semantic tags.
* Basic meta-information — charset, language (en).
* Social graph information (for Facebook, Reddit etc.).
* Basic [HTML5 Microdata](http://schema.org) markup.
* Layouts for posts and pages.
* Blank PNG favicon and blank touch icons (iOS, Android).
* RSS feed.
* Sitemap.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository. 

   > git clone https://github.com/liamzebedee/jekyll-html5-template

2. Modify the variables in `_config.yml` to suit your site.
3. Generate using Jekyll and start building your own site!

   > jekyll serve --watch
